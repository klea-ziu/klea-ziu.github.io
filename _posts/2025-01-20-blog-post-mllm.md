## What you'll learn:

Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) process data from different modalities like text, audio, image, and video. Compared to text-only models, MLLMs achieve richer contextual understanding and can integrate information across modalities, unlocking new areas of application.

The article covers:
- **Prime use cases**: Content creation, personalized recommendations, and human-machine interaction
- **Popular examples**: Microsoft's Kosmos-1, DeepMind's Flamingo, open-source LLaVA, and Google's PaLM-E
- **Key challenges**: Alignment of heterogeneous data, inherited biases, and robustness limitations
