Vanishing or exploding gradients are common training instabilities observed in foundation models.

Real-time gradient-norm monitoring using experiment trackers like neptune.ai enables early detection and mitigation.

Implementing stabilization techniques such as gradient clipping and optimizing weight initialization and learning rate schedules improves the training convergence and stability.
